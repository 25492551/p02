SULMISSION
Proceed only if this is an entirely new submission to Mathematics of Computation and you have read
the submission guidelines.
This form may be used to submit a PDF of your manuscript to Mathematics of Computation for
publication consideration. The PDF should include all text, graphics, and appendices for the paper. Do
not upload separate files for text, graphics, and appendices. This journal also accepts hardcopy paper
submissions as described on the Initial Submission for Peer Review page.
After you click Submit on the last step, you will receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive this
email, or if you are having problems with the form, please contact us at jrnl-initsub@ams.org.
This form should not be used to submit a revision of a previously submitted paper. If you are
trying to upload a revision of a previously submitted article, use the status link from the email you
received from us about your original submission. If you can’t find the link or the link doesn’t work, write
to us at jrni-initsub@ams.org.
No paper that has been previously published, or is being considered for publication elsewhere, should
be submitted to the American Mathematical Society, nor may a paper that is under consideration by the
American Mathematical Society be submitted elsewhere.
By clicking next to “I accept” below, you confirm that:
o The manuscript you are submitting is original and has not been previously published in whole
or in part.
© The manuscript is not currently under consideration for publication elsewhere, nor will it be
submitted to another journal while it is under consideration here.
oe This manuscript is not a revision of a rejected article previously submitted to this journal,
unless you have been explicitly invited to re-submit by the editorial board of this journal.

You also confirm that you have read and understood the AMS policy on the use of artificial intelligence
(Al) tools in scholarly publications. Specifically:
© Al tools, including ChatGPT and other large language models, cannot be listed as authors, as
they cannot take responsibility for the submitted work.
eo IfAl tools have been used in the preparation of this manuscript (e.g., for writing, graphics,
data collection, or analysis), this use must be disclosed in the manuscript’s Materials and
Methods (or equivalent) section, including the name of the Al tool used and its role.
e Authors remain fully responsible for all parts of the manuscript, including those involving Al
tools, and for any potential breach of publication ethics.
o Editors and referees will not upload submitted manuscripts to Al tools or LLMs to protect
confidentiality and copyright.
