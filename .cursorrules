# Project Rules: Riemann Zeta Function Visualization and Simulation Project

## Final Goal
- **Visualize and simulate non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function**: Explore the mathematical properties and physical interpretations of the zeros through visualization and simulation.
- Understand the distribution patterns, energy landscapes, and repulsion forces between zeros.
- Develop predictive models for zero locations using both statistical and physical approaches.

## Directory Structure (Priority Order)
The project follows a structured directory organization with the following priority:

1. **@01_data**: Math results
   - Contains mathematical results: manuscripts, analysis reports, final reports, and related data
   - Files in this directory should not be modified by automated processes
   - Riemann Zeta function zero data and related mathematical outputs belong here

2. **@02_log**: Job logging (Mandatory)
   - All jobs and tasks must be documented as markdown files in this directory
   - Contains job logs(`02_log/02_job/`) and chat(`02_log/01_chat/`) logs
   - Job logs are historical records of completed work
   - **Mandatory**: All jobs must be logged in the `02_log/02_job/` directory
   - **Active**: Cursor must actively reference and update job logs
   - Before starting a job, check existing logs. After completing a job, you must write a log entry
   - Job logging is mandatory, not optional

3. **@03_script**: Program code
   - Contains executable scripts and automation tools
   - All program code and executable files should be placed here
   - All Python scripts for visualization, simulation, and calculations are located here
   - Scripts should be used for:
     - Riemann Zeta function calculations and approximations
     - Visualization of zeros, energy landscapes, and vector fields
     - Particle simulations and Coulomb gas models
     - Zero prediction models
     - Sound synthesis from zero frequencies
   - Scripts should be well-documented with comments explaining their purpose and mathematical formulas
   - Scripts should generate visualizations (plots, graphs) and save them appropriately

4. **@04_layout**: Blueprint documents of this project
   - Contains design documents, architecture blueprints, and structural plans
   - Layout represents confirmed plans (finalized blueprints)

5. **@05_plan**: Plan for building or updating script or layout
   - Contains planning documents for building or updating scripts or layouts
   - Plans are under consideration (not yet finalized)
   - Plans, checklists, and future steps should be documented in `plan_*.md` files in this directory

6. **@06_docs**: Other docs
   - Run logs (e.g. GPU scalability logs), install notes, usage guides, and reference materials
   - **Mandatory**: Math results (reports, manuscripts) go in `01_data/`; other documentation (logs, how-to, reference) goes in `06_docs/`
   - Report naming: Use descriptive names like `[topic]_analysis.md` or `[topic]_report.md`
   - Generated visualizations and sound files should be saved in an appropriate location and referenced in reports

## Language Requirements (Mandatory)
- **All English**: All content in this project must be written in English
  - All code, comments, documentation, and project files must be in English
  - All structured data and their names must be in English
  - All documentation files (markdown files in `02_log/`, `04_layout/`, `05_plan/`, `06_docs/`) must be written in English
  - All project documentation (plans, layouts, job logs, general docs) must be written in English
  - Code-related documentation (inline comments, code documentation) must be in English
  - Database schema, table names, column names, and all identifiers must be in English
  - **All content in `.cursorrules` must be written in English** - This file serves as a reference for Cursor AI and should be in English for better compatibility

## Job Logging (**Mandatory**)
- All jobs and tasks must be documented as markdown files in the `02_log/02_job/` directory
- Each job should be tracked with appropriate markdown documentation
- Job logs should include relevant details such as task description, implementation steps, and outcomes
- Job logs are historical records of completed work - they should NOT contain plans, checklists, or future steps
- Plans, checklists, and future steps should be documented in `plan_*.md` files in the `05_plan/` directory
- **Mandatory**: After creating a new job log file, you **must** update `02_log/02_job/logmap_job.md`
- The logmap file contains summaries of all job log files in chronological order
- When adding a new entry to logmap_job.md:
  1. Add a new section with the job log filename as header (e.g., `### job_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`)
  2. Include: Job Date/Time, Job Overview (brief summary), Changed Files, and key details
  3. Update the "업데이트 기록" (Update Record) section at the bottom with the date
- Format: Follow the existing format in logmap_job.md for consistency
- This ensures all job logs are easily discoverable and summarized in one place

## Chat Log Usage
- The `02_log/01_chat/` directory is used by the user
- Users may make requests for referencing chat logs
- Chat logs serve as a communication history and reference point
- Cursor passively references chat logs
- Chat logs are only referenced when explicitly instructed by the user

## Installation and Dependencies
- You can ask the user about installation requirements
- Detour methods (workarounds) should be considered as a second option
- When installation is needed, prefer asking the user first before implementing alternative solutions

## Virtual Environment (venv)
- The project uses a Python virtual environment located in the `venv/` directory
- Always activate the virtual environment before running Python scripts or installing packages
- To activate: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Install all Python dependencies within the virtual environment
- Include `venv/` in `.gitignore` if version control is used
- When creating or modifying Python scripts, ensure they are compatible with the virtual environment
- Package installation command examples:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install [package_name]
  ```
- Or install by directly specifying the virtual environment:
  ```bash
  venv/bin/pip install [package_name]
  ```

## Script Directory
- The `03_script/` directory contains executable scripts and automation tools
- Scripts should be well-documented with clear purpose and usage instructions
- Follow consistent naming conventions for script files
- Scripts should be executable and include proper shebang lines when applicable
- All scripts must follow the project's language requirements (English for code and comments)
- Scripts related to database operations should follow PostgreSQL best practices

## Documentation
- Math results (reports, manuscripts) in `01_data/`; other docs (run logs, usage guides, reference) in `06_docs/`
- Documentation files should be in markdown format (.md) unless otherwise specified

## General Guidelines
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices for database design
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions
- Keep code and documentation organized and well-structured
- Ensure all database schemas and structures are properly documented

## Indexing
- All files in same folder should have integer index prefixed name.

## Date and Datetime Format (**Mandatory**)
- **ALL dates MUST include time information (HHMMSS)** - time information is mandatory and cannot be omitted
- All dates must be written in datetime format: YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS
- The time component (HHMMSS) is **REQUIRED** and must always be present
- **DO NOT** use dates without time information (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD is invalid)
- **DO NOT** use placeholder times like 000000 unless it is actually midnight (00:00:00)
- When creating or updating documents, always use the actual time when the work was performed
- Example: 2025-12-30T010101 (December 30, 2025 at 01:01:01)
- Example: 2024-12-22T113854 (December 22, 2024 at 11:38:54)
- Example: 2024-12-22T000000 (December 22, 2024 at 00:00:00) - only valid if work was actually done at midnight
- Use 24-hour format for time (HHMMSS)
- Leading zeros must be included for single-digit values
- When in doubt, use the current time or the actual time when the work was completed

## Number Notation with Base (**Mandatory**)
- **ALL numbers MUST explicitly indicate their base (radix)** - base notation is mandatory and cannot be omitted
- When writing numbers in documentation, always specify the base using standard notation:
  - **Decimal (base 10)**: Use suffix `_10` or prefix `(dec)` or explicitly state "decimal" or "base 10"
  - **Hexadecimal (base 16)**: Use prefix `0x` or suffix `_16` or explicitly state "hex" or "base 16"
  - **Binary (base 2)**: Use prefix `0b` or suffix `_2` or explicitly state "binary" or "base 2"
  - **Octal (base 8)**: Use prefix `0o` or suffix `_8` or explicitly state "octal" or "base 8"
- **Examples**:
  - Correct: `0x79BE667E` (hex), `508_10` (decimal), `0b1010` (binary)
  - Correct: `79BE667E (hex)` or `79BE667E (base 16)`
  - Incorrect: `79BE667E` (no base indication), `508` (no base indication for non-obvious decimal)
- **Exceptions**:
  - Date/time values (YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS format) are always decimal (base 10) and do not require explicit notation
  - File index numbers (e.g., `01_`, `02_`) are always decimal (base 10) and do not require explicit notation
  - Simple counting numbers in narrative text (e.g., "3 files", "10 values") are always decimal (base 10) and do not require explicit notation
  - Cryptographic keys, hash values, and addresses should ALWAYS specify base (typically hexadecimal)
  - Large numbers that could be ambiguous should always specify base
- When in doubt, always specify the base explicitly

## Workflow
1. Use files from the `@01_data` folder for data analysis tasks (optional)
2. Check existing logs in `02_log/02_job/` before starting a job
3. **Must** record job content in `02_log/02_job/` after completing a job (mandatory)
4. Chat logs are only checked when requested by the user
5. Use scripts from the `03_script/` folder for calculations, visualizations, and simulations
6. **Must** put math results (analysis reports, manuscripts) in `01_data/`; put other docs (logs, how-to) in `06_docs/` (mandatory)
7. Save generated visualizations and output files appropriately and document them in reports
