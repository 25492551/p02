# Project Rules: Riemann Zeta Function Visualization and Simulation Project

## Final Goal
- **Visualize and simulate non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function**: Explore the mathematical properties and physical interpretations of the zeros through visualization and simulation.
- Understand the distribution patterns, energy landscapes, and repulsion forces between zeros.
- Develop predictive models for zero locations using both statistical and physical approaches.

## Language Requirement
- **All content in `.cursorrules` must be written in English.**
- This file serves as a reference for Cursor AI and should be in English for better compatibility.

## Data Sources
- All source data is located in the `data/` directory.
- Use the `@data` folder when referencing data files.
- Riemann Zeta function zero data and related mathematical data should be stored in `data/`.

## Logging Rules

### Job Log - Mandatory and Active
- **Mandatory**: All jobs must be logged in the `log/job log/` directory.
- **Active**: Cursor must actively reference and update job logs.
- Job logs record project progress and executed tasks.
- Before starting a job, check existing logs. After completing a job, you must write a log entry.
- Job logging is mandatory, not optional.

### Job Log Map - Mandatory Update
- **Mandatory**: After creating a new job log file, you **must** update `log/job log/logmap_job.md`.
- The logmap file contains summaries of all job log files in chronological order.
- When adding a new entry to logmap_job.md:
  1. Add a new section with the job log filename as header (e.g., `### job_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`)
  2. Include: Job Date/Time, Job Overview (brief summary), Changed Files, and key details
  3. Update the "업데이트 기록" (Update Record) section at the bottom with the date
- Format: Follow the existing format in logmap_job.md for consistency.
- This ensures all job logs are easily discoverable and summarized in one place.

### Chat Log
- All chat conversations are logged in the `log/chat log/` directory by user.
- Cursor passively references chat logs.
- Chat logs are only referenced when explicitly instructed by the user.

## Virtual Environment Usage Rules
- The project has a `venv/` virtual environment configured.
- When installing Python packages, you must activate and use the virtual environment.
- Package installation command examples:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install [package_name]
  ```
- Or install by directly specifying the virtual environment:
  ```bash
  venv/bin/pip install [package_name]
  ```

## Script Folder Rules
- All Python scripts for visualization, simulation, and calculations are located in the `script/` directory.
- Scripts in the `script/` folder should be used for:
  - Riemann Zeta function calculations and approximations
  - Visualization of zeros, energy landscapes, and vector fields
  - Particle simulations and Coulomb gas models
  - Zero prediction models
  - Sound synthesis from zero frequencies
- When creating scripts, use the virtual environment (`venv/`) for package management.
- Scripts should be well-documented with comments explaining their purpose and mathematical formulas.
- Scripts should generate visualizations (plots, graphs) and save them appropriately.

## Report Folder Rules
- **Mandatory**: All analysis results and reports must be written in the `report/` directory.
- **Active**: Cursor must actively create and update reports when performing data analysis or visualization.
- Report files should be well-structured markdown documents containing:
  - Analysis objectives and methodology
  - Data sources and processing steps
  - Analysis results with tables, statistics, and visualizations (if applicable)
  - Conclusions and observations
  - Date and time of report generation
- Report naming convention: Use descriptive names like `[analysis_topic]_analysis.md` or `[visualization_topic]_report.md`.
- When performing data analysis tasks or visualization work, you **must** create a report in the `report/` folder documenting the analysis results.
- Reporting is mandatory, not optional.

## Visualization and Output Rules
- Generated visualizations (plots, graphs, images) should be saved in appropriate locations (e.g., project root or `data/` directory).
- Sound files generated from zero frequencies should be saved with descriptive names.
- All output files should be referenced in reports when relevant.

## Workflow
1. Use files from the `@data` folder for data analysis tasks (optional).
2. Check existing logs in `log/job log/` before starting a job.
3. **Must** record job content in `log/job log/` after completing a job (mandatory).
4. Chat logs are only checked when requested by the user.
5. Use scripts from the `script/` folder for calculations, visualizations, and simulations.
6. **Must** create analysis reports in the `report/` folder after completing data analysis or visualization work (mandatory).
7. Save generated visualizations and output files appropriately and document them in reports.
